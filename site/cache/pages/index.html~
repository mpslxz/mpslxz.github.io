Injection therapy is a commonly used solution for back pain management. This procedure typically involves percutaneous insertion of a needle between or around the vertebrae, to deliver anesthetics near nerve bundles. Most frequently, spinal injections are either performed blindly using palpation, or under the guidance of fluoroscopy or Computed Tomography. Recently, due to the drawbacks of the ionizing radiation of such imaging modalities, there has been a growing interest in using ultrasound imaging as an alternative. However, the complex spinal anatomy with different wave-like structures (see the figure), affected by speckle noise, makes the accurate identification of the appropriate injection plane difficult. The aim of this study is to propose an automated system that can identify the optimal plane for epidural steroid injections and facet joint injections.

Accurate identification of the needle target is crucial for effective spinal injections. 
Currently, epidural needle placement is administered by a manual technique, relying on the sense of feel, which has a significant failure rate. Moreover, misleading the needle may lead to inadequate anesthesia, post dural puncture headaches and other potential complications. Ultrasound offers guidance to the physician for identification of the needle target, but accurate interpretation and localization remain challenges. We introduce a feature augmentation technique that incorporates convolutional feature maps, which are obtained by convolutional layers, with multi-scale local directional Hadamard features. Since the multi-scale Hadamard features are sensitive to the directionality of the US echoes from the surface of the vertebrae in the US image, the augmentation provides the deep network with a set of distinctive directional features from the sequency domain in addition to the feature maps automatically obtained from the spatial domain.

Deep learning models have outperformed some of the previous state-of-the-art approaches in medical image analysis. 
Instead of using hand-engineered features, deep models attempt to automatically extract hierarchical representations at multiple levels of abstraction from the data.
However, utilizing deep models during image-guided therapy procedures requires integration of several software components which is often a tedious task for clinical researchers. 
Hence, there is a gap between the state-of-the-art machine learning research and its application in clinical setup.
In this paper, we propose an open-source toolkit for medical image analysis with deep learning models in 3D Slicer, called "DeepInfer".
